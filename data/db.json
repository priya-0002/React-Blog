The first season features some gun violence, and there is a monster and graphic violence associated with that monster that could be disturbing for some viewers.The second and third seasons are much more violent and graphic, and Iâ€™m guessing that could be where many parents draw the line with this series. The second season ramps up the violence, especially the graphic violence associated with the monsters. ",
